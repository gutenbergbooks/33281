<h2>VOCES POPULI.</h2>

<h3>IN THE MALL ON DRAWING-ROOM DAY.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
<i>The line of carriages bound for Buckingham Palace is moving by
slow stages down the Drive. A curious but not uncritical crowd,
consisting largely of females, peer into the carriages as they pass,
and derive an occult pleasure from a glimpse of a satin train and
a bouquet. Other spectators circulate behind them, roving from
carriage to carriage, straining and staring in at the occupants
with the childlike interest of South Sea Islanders. The coachmen
and footmen gaze impassively before them, ignoring the
crowd to the best of their ability. The ladies in the carriages
bear the ordeal of popular inspection with either haughty
resignation, elaborate unconsciousness, or amused tolerance, and
it is difficult to say which demeanour provokes the greatest
resentment in the democratic breast.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="ind"><i>Chorus of Female Spectators.</i></span> We shall see better here than what
we did last Droring-Room. Law, 'ow it <i>did</i> come down, too, pouring
the 'ole day. I was that sorry for the poor 'orses!... Oh, that one
<i>was</i> nice, <span class="sc">Marire</span>! Did you see 'er train?&mdash;all flame-coloured

Ain't them flowers beautiful? Oh, <span class="sc">Liza</span>, <i>'ere's</i> a pore

at 'er pore dear arms, all
bare! But dressed 'andsome
enough.... That's a Gineral in

cocked 'at on his knee to save the
feathers&mdash;him and her have been
'aving words, apparently ... Oh,
I <i>do</i> like this one. I s'pose that's
her Mother with her&mdash;well, yes,
o' course it <i>may</i> be her Aunt?</p>

<p><span class="ind"><i>The R. L.</i> Nonsense</span>, it is all

she looking nice? I couldn't
exactly make out which was her

"Here is my last request and legacy! After we are executed, and while the impression of this epilogue of all these horrors is still fresh in
the minds of the people, do your utmost to make this new example of the unparalleled cruelty of Russian despotism known to the whole world....
This is a great task well worth accomplishing; and if you succeed, the losses we suffered in that terrible butchery will be redeemed."&mdash;<i>From the
last letter, written just before his execution, of Nicholas Zotoff, one of the victims of the Yakoutsk massacre.</i>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Bancroft's</span> "Little Play" is very good work. It is called
<i>The Riverside</i>; it drew a big <i>Matinée</i> house at the Haymarket last
Thursday, and drew big tears. The ladies did enjoy themselves!
They were in full cry all the time. Capitally acted. It is rumoured
that the gifted authoress, manageress, and actress (all in one), is
going to take a company up the river in a House-boat fitted as a
Theatre. It is to be called <i>The Thespis</i>, and will visit all the principal
places on the river during the Season, and ought to do uncommonly
well. The idea is novel. The Company will be called "The
Bancroft Water-Babies." <i>À propos</i> of the Busy B.'s, we are
authorised to contradict the report that, in consequence of his great
success as an arbitrator, Mr. <span class="sc">Bancroft</span> is to be made a Deputy-Assistant
County Court Judge. This is not so.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The First Roze of Summer.</span>&mdash;Our Chirruping Critic off the hearth
went to Madame <span class="sc">Marie Roze's</span> Concert the other day&mdash;advertised as
"Grand Morning Concert"&mdash;well, it was a "Grand Morning" for the
time of year&mdash;but why was the Concert "Grand?"&mdash;and was delighted.
The Chirruper heartily welcomed Miss <span class="sc">Grace Damian</span>&mdash;more graceful
than ever&mdash;she sang grandly&mdash;of course everyone did on this "grand"
occasion&mdash;and he nearly split a pair of gloves applauding Mr. <span class="sc">Leo
Stern</span> in his Grand Violoncello act, for which he was recalled three
times, till he was quite tired of bowing and "boo'ing." But the
Chirruper would not have it otherwise, "Touch not a single bow,"
as the song says. And then the flowers! five bouquets for Madame
<span class="sc">Marie Roze</span>. "The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la!" as the
late firm of <span class="sc">Gilbert and Sullivan</span> used to sing and play. <i>À
propos</i>
of Mr. <span class="sc">Gilbert</span>, his <i>protégée</i>, Miss <span class="sc">Neilson</span>, whom he was
the first to
bring out in Brantingham Hall, St. James's, S.W., gave a recitation
which made a decided hit; and then she sang a song&mdash;accomplished
young lady is Miss <span class="sc">Julia</span>&mdash;which made another hit. The Chirruper
wishes to record that&mdash;to a quartette "specially arranged for the
Meister Glee Singers", called <i>Dinah Doe</i>, and excellently sung, no
names were given of either the Shakspearian Librettist, or the
Composer, <span class="sc">J. L. Molloy</span>, who wrote it for the <span class="sc">German Reeds</span> many
years ago. It's as fresh as ever, and at this grand concert came
out grandly. The Steinway piano was of course a grand.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 19.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Old Morality</span> in new
and charming mood to-night; turned over a fresh leaf in his copybook;
entered upon the chapter headed "Banter;" not only enjoyed
himself, but was cause of enjoyment in others. <span class="sc">Esslemont</span> began
it; doled out, as if it were ounce of tea or
yard and quarter of calico, ponderous joke
about having no Holiday at Whitsuntide, and
adding three days to Recess at end of Session.</p>

<p>"I will take a note of the Hon. Member's
recommendation," said <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px"><a href="images/256-1-300.png"><img src="images/256-1-100.png" width="100" height="271" alt="'Such badinage! such persiflage!'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Such badinage! such<br /> persiflage!"</p></div>

<p>Nobody laughs when I tell this; yet,
remember, House roared whilst <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>,
resuming seat, sat with pursed-up lips
and furrowed brow, fearful lest he should
spoil situation by smiling. Must have told
the joke wrong; look up Parliamentary Reports.
No, there it is, the very words; also
his retort to <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span>; his turning the
flank of <span class="sc">Harcourt</span>; his triumphant knocking
over of <span class="sc">Tim</span>, when, after brief pause, he came
up again.</p>

<p>"Such badinage!" said <span class="sc">Charles Wilson</span>,
"such persiflage!"</p>

<p>So it seemed at time. Everyone roared with
delight.</p>

<p>"Quite in <span class="sc">Dizzy's</span> style," said the admiring
<span class="sc">Stanhope</span>.</p>

<p>"Only better," added the ecstatic <span class="sc">Georgy
Hamilton</span>.</p>

<p>Thought so too at the time; but when I
come to write down the jokes, the fun has
gone, the flavour escaped, the bloom shed.
Wonder what it was we all laughed at?</p>

<p>"You do your best," said the Member for
Sark, always ready with kindly remark, "but
you can't bring <span class="sc">Old Morality</span> and all he
is to us on your written page. His voice, his looks, his way of getting
up and of sitting down, his throwing back his head and thrusting
forward his chin as he mouths his apophthegm, his nervous glance
round the House, his assumption of a stern official aspect, breaking
presently into a smile when the House laughs; his apologetic way of
sitting on the edge of the seat when he has snubbed <span class="sc">Harcourt</span>; all
his goodness, his littleness, his honest intention, and his occasional
lapses into crooked paths; his 'Certainly, Sir,' when the thing is
quite otherwise, his blush when he discovers himself dealing with
facts in a Pickwickian sense, his constitutional modesty, and his
spasmodic aggressiveness, the look in his eye as of a wounded hare
when <span class="sc">Courtney</span> refuses to put the Closure he has moved,&mdash;all
these are things, little in themselves, momentary
in their passage, which you, dear <span class="sc">Toby</span>,
can no more transfer to your folios than you
can illuminate them with the glow of sunset,
or perfume them with the scent of country
lanes in this sweet spring-time. <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>
belongs to us. He is a peculiar growth of the
House of Commons, unique, unprecedented,
unapproachable, never fully to be understanded
of, or appreciated by, the people."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Battling round Budget Bill;
sat all night, and far into morning.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 170px"><a href="images/256-2-300.png"><img src="images/256-2-100.png" width="100" height="291" alt="Going down to the House." /></a>
<p class="center">Going down to the House.</p></div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Cadogan</span> in good time at House
of Lords to-day. <span class="sc">Denman</span> got first place with
Motion for Second Reading of his Bill extending
Municipal Franchise in Ireland. <span class="sc">Cadogan</span> to
move rejection of Measure in name of Government.</p>

<p>"I must be firm," he said, as he turned up
his trousers over his white spats. "<span class="sc">Denman</span>
a terrible fellow when he's roused."</p>

<p>House pretty full when <span class="sc">Denman</span> appeared
at table in position of Leader of Opposition.
An ordinary Member not connected with either
present or late Government, usually speaks
from Bench on which he is accustomed to sit.
<span class="sc">Denman</span> preferred conveniences of table. Most
interesting speech, what could be heard of it.
Good deal about Sir <span class="sc">Robert Peel</span>; occasional
reference to <span class="sc">Palmerston</span>; some reminiscences of
early journey in railway-carriage in <span class="sc">Stephenson's</span>
time; a passing remark as to the weather, and probable state
of the crops on this day six months. But, as <span class="sc">Cadogan</span> subsequently
remarked, nothing whatever about the Bill. Lords in an awkward
position. Had the scene been in the Commons, and the elderly grey-haired
gentleman at the table been merely returned by a constituency,
the case would have been different. Might have been howled
down in a few moments. But with a Peer of the Realm, a hereditary
legislator, a personage whose vote might in certain conceivable circumstances
suffice to throw out a Bill which had received sanction of
House of Commons, it is, as <span class="sc">Granville</span> says, <i>une autre paire de
manches</i>. If anyone whispered that <span class="sc">Denman</span> had a tile off, whither
would the admission lead us? A Peer is a man&mdash;or rather, a Being&mdash;of
a special, superlative order. Admitted within that order, he
becomes, <i>ipso facto</i>, a person of extraordinary intelligence, keen
intellect, ripe judgment, irreproachable character.</p>

<p>A little awkward that <span class="sc">Denman</span> should seem to be rambling. If
he were a Commoner, might even be called incoherent. Being a
Peer, some forty or fifty other Peers sat through twenty minutes
with polite assumption of listening. But there is a substratum of
human nature even in the Peerage. When <span class="sc">Denman</span>, <i>à propos</i> of
the Municipal Franchise in Ireland, began to talk about <span class="sc">Columbus's</span>
egg, there was a murmur of impatience; when he slid into the
Panama Canal the murmur grew to a shout. Awhile, amid stormy
cries for the Division, the House of Lords resembled the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>After brief struggle with unwonted elements, <span class="sc">Denman</span> resumed
seat; Bill thrown out, and with regained equanimity noble Lords
turned to next business. To their horror, <span class="sc">Denman</span> up again at
table; forgotten to mention a particular circumstance connected
with <span class="sc">Columbus's</span> egg. "Perhaps their Lordships&mdash;&mdash;" But this too
much. At whatever risk to Peerage as a body, <span class="sc">Denman</span> must be
shouted down. So they roared at him with cries of "Order!" he
standing regarding them with looks of pained surprise. Was it
possible they declined to hear more about <span class="sc">Columbus's</span> egg? "Order!
Order!" they roared, <span class="sc">Bath</span> leading the onslaught.</p>

<p>"It is you, my Lords, who are disorderly," said <span class="sc">Denman</span>, and
with head erect, and tall figure carried with pathetic dignity, he
strode back to Cross Benches, and sat down in seat of <span class="sc">Prince Of
Wales</span>.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Bill in Commons.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;All the blood of his great predecessor in spoliation,
<span class="sc">Henry the Eighth</span>, just now swelled in the bosom of <span class="sc">James
Stuart Allanson Tudor Picton</span>. Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> responsible for
the flood. Question about meeting announced to be held in Mid-Tipperary
next Sunday. Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> has, it seems, prohibited
it. <span class="sc">John Morley</span> wants to know why? There was, he says, public
meeting held in same place last month, addressed by English Members;
that not proclaimed. What was the difference between
meeting addressed by Irish Members, and another by English Members,
that one should be taken and the other left?</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 160px"><a href="images/256-3-300.png"><img src="images/256-3-100.png" width="100" height="272" alt="Pease (with Honour)." /></a>
<p class="center">Pease (with Honour).</p></div>

<p>"The difference is," said Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, speaking with embarrassed
air, as if the distinction was dragged
out of him, "that the result of the meeting
addressed by Irish Members was to produce
intimidation, whilst the result of the other
was, I should say, <i>nil</i>."</p>

<p>If <span class="sc">James Stuart Allanson Tudor Picton</span>
had only lived in the times of his great predecessor,
and wielded his power, Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>
would forthwith have been conducted
to Tower Hill, and shortened by a head.
Why he (<span class="sc">James</span>, &amp;c.) was at this meeting at
Mid-Tipperary last month! He, standing on
a butter-tub, had addressed the men of Tipperary;
the echo of his eloquence still filled
the dales, whilst the hills reverberated with
the cheers of the men of Tipperary. For this
insolent hireling of a Coercionist Government
to speak in tones of studied slight of such a
demonstration was more than J. S. A. T. P.
could stand. If our two giants, <span class="sc">John O'Connor</span>
and <span class="sc">Henry Pease</span> had not joined hands
and held him back, gore would have sprinkled
the precincts of the Treasury Bench. As it
was, the subject dropped, and House proceeded
to discuss Budget Bill.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;A good lead.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;House adjourned for holidays.
"When we come back," says <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>,
"we must really begin work. Playtime up
to now; left most of the work over;
must buckle to. We've been in some
danger, and there may be more ahead. Why are persons sometimes
killed by leaning over beer-vats? Because vats, when beer
has been made, contain large quantities of carbonic acid gas, produced
by the vinous fermentation of the beer; and when a man
incautiously leans over a beer-vat and inhales the carbonic acid, he
is killed thereby. It is, of course, not quite the same in respect of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg 257]</span>
spirits. Still, when a Chancellor of Exchequer has clapped on sixpence
a gallon on whiskey, it is as well for his colleagues to avoid
looking a Scotch hogshead or an Irish puncheon in the face. <i>Au
plaisir, cher</i> <span class="sc">Toby</span>. Come along, <span class="sc">Jackson</span>!"</p>

<p>The two Right Honourables go off together, <span class="sc">Jackson</span> evidently
turning over in his mind <span class="sc">Old Morality's</span> observations on the beer-vat.</p>

<p>"A wonderful man," he says, "his mind stored with odd bits of
information, which he draws upon for enlightenment upon ordinary
events of daily life. Don't exactly see, though, how he rolled in
that beer-vat. Must think it over during the Recess."</p>

<p>Everyone glad to hail <span class="sc">Jackson</span> "Right Honourable." A proud
title, as yet not spoiled by indiscriminate distribution. Suffices for
<span class="sc">Gladstone</span>, as it did for <span class="sc">Peel</span>; suits <span class="sc">Jackson</span> exactly.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Winding up for Whitsuntide. Adjourn for holidays
till Monday, June 2nd.</p>

<h3>THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.</h3>

<p><i>From the Note-book of Mr. Pips Senior.</i>&mdash;<i>Monday, May 19.</i>&mdash;To the
Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. First night of the Season. The
house infinite full, and the Prince of <span class="sc">Wales</span> and the Princess, and
the Princesses their daughters, there in a box, pretty to see. <span class="sc">Druriolanus
Operaticus et Counticouncillarius</span> mightily pleased at
what I hear is the biggest subscription
to this class of entertainment
ever known. Many
fine faces here to-day. The sight
of the ladies exceeding noble. </p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px"><a href="images/257-500.png"><img src="images/257-250.png" width="250" height="394" alt="'Harmony in Black and White.'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Harmony in Black and White."</p></div>

<p>A new wench, Mlle. <span class="sc">Nuovina</span>, to
sing for the first time, taking the
part of <i>Marguérite</i> in the Opera
of <i>Faust</i>, which she did prettily
and quietly. Curious to see a
<i>Marguérite</i> with jet-black hair
and a white face; yet comely
and with much grace.</p>

<p>Everyone extraordinarily content
with Mons. <span class="sc">Jean de Reszké</span>,
the best <i>Faust</i> that did ever sing
and play this part. But vexed
to see one M. <span class="sc">Orme Darrall</span> act
<i>Mephistopheles</i> in the room of
<span class="sc">Edouard de Reszké</span>, who, poor
man, is sick. The scenes and the
chorus all very fine indeed. All
of us pretty merry at the droll
mimicry of Mlle. <span class="sc">Bauermeister</span>
as <i>Martha</i>, who makes this part
go most rarely.</p>

<p>Pleased to see Madame <span class="sc">Scalchi</span>
dressed as a boy for the part of <i>Siebel</i>. The house mightily content,
and wishing her to sing one song twice over, which she would not.
In which matter she did wisely, as also the others.</p>

<p>Went out before the last Act began, to find it raining heavily,
and, good lack! not a <i>Commissionnaire</i> to be met with for a quarter
of an hour. Whereat mightily troubled to get a coach, till one did
fetch me a four-wheeler, which I entered, in great disorder, after
much strife and contention. Cost me sixpence. To <span class="sc">Rule's</span>, in
Maiden Lane, being mighty thirsty, where had supper on excellent
lobster and fresh salad, with eggs of the plover, and a draught of the
best stout, which did much content me. Comes young <span class="sc">Silligrew</span>,
who makes merry about "sticking to Rules for supper and no exception,"
or some such nonsense, which I have forgot, though we laughed
heartily at his manner of saying it. Drank to the success of the
Italian Opera and of <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span>. After paying the reckoning,
took cab, and so home to bed.</p>

<p><i>From Note-book of Mr. Pips Junior.</i>&mdash;<i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Pips</span> Senior
doesn't go to Opera to-night. <span class="sc">Pips</span> Junior does. Think <span class="sc">Pips</span>
Senior,
as an Admiralty official, will be at the Court Ball with Madame
<span class="sc">Pips</span>. Glad, therefore, to take his stall at the Opera. <i>Carmen</i>
always
delightful. Tuneful, melodious, and bright. Good Bizet-ness. Mlle.
<span class="sc">Zélie de Lussan</span> as <i>Carmen</i> mighty difficult to beat, and she
sings and plays the part with all the diabolical waywardness of this
impudent Spanish baggage, as <span class="sc">Pips</span> Senior would call her. Pity
that <span class="sc">Maggie McIntyre</span> is indisposed to play <i>Michaela</i>; she used
to do it so prettily and so innocently that she shone out as just the
very contrast intended by the author. Instead of <span class="sc">Maggie</span>, Mlle.
<span class="sc">Colombati</span> sings the part to-night. She is very graciously received,
as is also Signor <span class="sc">Fernando Valero</span> (from several Opera Houses
abroad) who makes his <i>début</i> here as that vacillating tenor, <span class="sc">Don
José</span>. Clever Mlle. <span class="sc">Bauermeister</span> as frisky <i>Frasquita</i>, and
Mlle.
<span class="sc">Longhi</span> as <i>Mercedes</i>, both excellent Bohemian Girls. To see them
going nap was a treat! Which wins? One excellent Irish-Italian,
<span class="sc">Dan Drady</span>, as the <i>Toréador</i>, first-rate. What a song it is!
<i>Encores</i>
refused all round, of course. In spite of State Ball, House very
nearly as full as on first night. Brilliant effect of some ladies who
are "going on," and who can't of course "go on anyhow," but are
obliged to appear in their diamonds.</p>

<p>Pretty to see little Mlle. <span class="sc">Palladino</span> dancing. Very short life
and a merry one has the <i>première danseuse</i> in this Opera. Just a few
steps, and then she "steps it," and is not seen again. There is
too little of <span class="sc">Palladino</span> at any time, and in this case, as she only
comes on for five minutes at the commencement of Act II., and then
"<i>bon soir!</i>" she may be described as "Small and Early."</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<i>Rentrée</i> of Mlle. <span class="sc">Ella Russell</span> as <i>Leila</i>
in <span class="sc">Bizet's</span>
<i>I Pescatori di Perle</i>, another version of <i>The Diversions of Purley</i>,
a work now more or less forgotten. Signor <span class="sc">Valero</span> better as <i>Nadir</i>
(isn't this the name of a well-known photographer?) than as <i>Don José</i>.
Not unlike the lamented <span class="sc">Gayarre</span>. The more like he can become
to that tenor the better. M. <span class="sc">Dufriche</span> came from Madrid to play
<i>Zurga</i>. A long journey; almost sorry he gave himself the
trouble, but there's more than this for him to do. Lovely finish to
First Act, but after that the Opera is not a stirring one, the story
being so idiotically undramatic. <span class="sc">Ella</span> fresher than ever.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;<i>Lohengrin.</i> Wagnerian worshippers in their thousands.
What shall she do who comes after <i>Albani</i> in the part of <i>Elsa</i>?
That is the question, and <span class="sc">Maggie McIntyre</span> supplies the answer,
which is Uncommonly well. A sweet picture in a gentle frame of
mind, so Macintirely pure and simple. A trying, very trying, part.
How grand are the <span class="sc">De Reszkés</span>&mdash;<span class="sc">Jean</span> and <span class="sc">Edouard</span>&mdash;or
more
familiarly as we come to know them better, <span class="sc">Jack</span> and <span class="sc">Ned</span>.
<span class="sc">Ned</span>
looking well, and singing so too, in spite of recent chill. Warmth
of reception to-night would thaw any chill. But what a couple of
bores are the characters of <i>Ortruda</i> and <i>Telramondo</i>, even when
superbly played as to-night, by Madame <span class="sc">Fursch-Madi</span>&mdash;(the real
Mahdi at last!)&mdash;and Signor <span class="sc">Dan Drady</span>, bedad! Fortunately
the Opera is considerably curtailed, or we should never hear the
last of it.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;<i>Il Trovatore.</i> Great night for "the big, big D",&mdash;that
is, for "the high D," on which the new tenor, M. <span class="sc">Rawner</span>,
alights with a sudden bound that electrifies the house. His "high
D" is quite an <i>Eiffel tour de force</i>. Henceforth <span class="sc">M. Rawner</span> must
be known as "the High D-iddle-diddle" tenor, and His Highness
will be expected to sustain his high reputation. Vocal effort almost
eclipsed by wonderful physical force, which enables him to burst
through the prison walls and bow to audience, who are enthusiastically
applauding the <i>Miserere</i>. Unfortunately M. <span class="sc">Rawner</span>,
being a stranger in these parts, cannot find his way back again, and
so is unavoidably prevented from being present at his own execution,
which, in his absence, takes place without him. Madame <span class="sc">Tetrazzina</span>&mdash;her
first appearance here&mdash;not so great, perhaps, as she is good and
graceful. <span class="sc">Dan Drady</span> and Madame <span class="sc">Scalchi</span> as "per usual," which
is the highest praise. End of first week. General satisfaction.</p>

<h2>THE PLEASURE-SEEKER'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p><i>Q.</i> I trust you have had a delightful time recently?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Indeed I have, with the assistance of Private Views, Special
Performances, and Second-rate First Nights.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did you assist at the <i>première</i> of <i>Gretna Green</i>, the new
"Comedy Opera" at the Opéra Comique?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> An Act of it. It had already been played on a previous
occasion, when I fancy one of the principal performers, finding that
his part was dragging, introduced imitations of popular modern
actors. As the period of <i>Gretna Green</i> is the eighteenth century,
this innovation must have been at once pleasing and appropriate.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> I think you have also been present at the first performance of
the "Wild East," at the Earl's Court Exhibition?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I have had that advantage, and am now thoroughly conversant
with the manners and customs of our lively neighbours in
some parts of Africa.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Are those manners and customs what may be termed&mdash;quaint?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> They are very quaint. Still I am not sure that I have not
seen something very like them before. As for the Exhibition itself,
there is as little doubt about its being French, as there was about
last year's display being Spanish.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Have you been to the Flower Show at the Aquarium?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I have; but did not find that home of scientific research quite
so full as it was when the Directors were testing the powers of
endurance of the Fasting Man.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do you consider the Westminster Aquarium of material
assistance in developing the latent civilisation of the nineteenth
century?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Indeed, I do; especially now that "the Royal Bears" are a
feature in the daily programme.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did you pass the Bank Holiday pleasantly?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> When I tell you that I seized the opportunity to go to Calais
and back third-class excursion with a number of anti-temperance-movement
fellow passengers, you will see at once that the festival
must have been to me a source of unmixed enjoyment!</p>

<h3>ROBERT AT GUILDHALL.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Well</span>, if we aint bin and had a fine time
of it at Gildhall this last week or two, it's a
pitty! What the pore harf-starved County
Counsellors must have thort of it all, it isn't
for me to say, and how they all felt when the
ginerous old Copperashun tossed 'em a few
dozzen tickets to skrambel for, when the great
Mr. <span class="sc">Stanley</span> came to supper, of course I carnt
tell, but them few as I knowed seemed to find
their way to my refreshment department as if
by hinstinkt. I didn't, of course, hear the
grate Traweller's grand speech, but I'm told
as my pore namesake, Sir <span class="sc">Robert Fowler</span>
M.P.'s face was a site to see while he lissened
to sitch a descripshun of his Quaker Friends
as he probberbly never heard afore.</p>

<p>There was grate complaints made about the
want of enuff wittles and drink, but anyone
who seed, as I did, the fust rush for 'em by
the hungry mob, couldn't have been much
surprised at that. Why, I myself seed, with
my two estonished eyes, one gent, as I spose
he called hisself, take up a hole dish of most
lovely Hoyster Pattys, and skoop out all the
Hoysters with a spoon, and then return the
hemty Pattys from whence they came! Feeling
as I couldn't be of no more use after there
was nothink left for me to hand to the fresh
mob as kept on arriving, I quietly warked off,
and made my way to the supper-room, where
the hemenent Traweller was aswaging the
pangs of hunger with reel Turtel Soup and
setterer. Ah! what a contrast! Plenty of
everythink, and plenty of room to enjoy it.</p>

<p>With that abundant kindness as so distinguishes
him, the <span class="sc">Lord Mare</span> acshally hintroduced
me to the Ero of the Heavening, who
kindly shook hands with me, and hoped as how
as we shood meet again, which I can quite
bleeve if he thinks as it allers includes reel
Turtel Soup, and setterer. Rayther different
living to what he has bin accustomed to for
3 years parst, pore Feller! They tell me as
he as bin to the Mountins of the Moon.
Evins! ow did he get back? By balloon.
But I don't kwite bleeve horl I eers.</p>

<p>But on the following Friday there wasn't
not no xceptions to anythink, and everrybody,
from the Prince of <span class="sc">Wales</span> hisself, down
to the werry umblest Postman or Sorter, left
that nobel old Hall, estonished, and delited,
and appy.</p>

<p>And no wunder, for, by the combined efforts
of the hole Copperashun and its werry numerus
Staff, and the hole Army of Postmen,
and Tellacram Men, and all manner of Sorters,
and Stampers, St. Martin's-le-Grand was removed
boddily to Gildall, and everything
that was ever done in the one place was dun
in the other before the estonished eyes of sum
two thousand of us, ewen includin four-horse
Male Coaches, with sacks of letters, and reel
Gards with reel Horns, which they blowed
most butifully. It was a gloreus Jewbelee!
I'm that bizzy I hardly noes wich way to
turn first, so no more at pressunt from yores
trewly,</p>

<h2>A MID-DAY MEAL-LENNIUM.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="center">(<i>With Salutation to the "Society for the Promotion
of Enjoyment during Luncheon Hours,
specially in the City."</i>)</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="sc">Lunching as it Is.</span></h3>

<p>No, I certainly did <i>not</i> order Irish Stew;
but as you have now brought it, and I have
been waiting a quarter of an hour for a cut
from the joint, I prefer to take it.</p>

<p>This room is very stuffy and crowded. Is
that purple-faced gentleman in the corner
suffering from an apoplectic stroke?</p>

<p>No; but <i>he</i> has been waiting <i>half</i> an hour
for the Irish Stew which I have just annexed.
He seems angry about it.</p>

<p>Waiter, would you try not to kick my
chair and knock the back of my head every
time you pass with a dish?</p>

<p>Yes, I know it's a narrow gangway, and
that everybody in this dark and confined crib
which you call a City Restaurant is cramped
for room; still, I <i>do</i> object to collisions between
my best hat and somebody else's
victuals.</p>

<p>Would you mind talking to me in the Deaf
and Dumb Alphabet? In this maddening
clatter it is impossible to hear a word you say.</p>

<p>That young man three from me is evidently
training as the Champion Express Eater of
the World. He has got through joint, potatoes,
rhubarb tart, and Cheddar cheese in
seven minutes, and is now putting on his hat
to go.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">As it Ought to be.</span></h3>

<p>Is this spacious airy hall, with a fountain
playing in the middle of shrubs, and abundant
light coming in through painted windows,
really the "Apple-pie Restaurant" in
its new form?</p>

<p>And this neat-handed Phyllis, who respectfully
awaits my orders as soon as I have
taken my very comfortable seat, <i>can</i> she be
the substitute for the over-worked and distracted
City waiter of the past?</p>

<p>I see that especial care is taken to prevent
the room being filled with more lunchers than
it can hold with comfort to each individual
customer, by an apparatus which automatically
closes the door when every seat is full.</p>

<p>What! No shooting down of one's plate
before one as if fired from a catapult, and
no tedious waiting for dishes never ordered!
This is a Luncher's Paradise.</p>

<p>It seems possible that I may now escape
the dyspepsia which, in the old days, was
the unfailing legacy of lunch.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p>Not much time for books this week, says the Baron; just been
able to glance at <span class="sc">W. S. Lilly's</span> <i>Right and Wrong</i>: verdict&mdash;so
far,
all right, nothing wrong. Sharp chapter on journalism&mdash;severe, but
not unjust. Picked up small book, for which inquire at <span class="sc">W. H.
Smith's</span> bookstalls, <i>Four Thousand Years After</i>, by <span class="sc">Helen L.
Chevalier</span>. Baroness having read it, highly recommends it in hot
weather, as being a weird, mystical legend, of a soothing and interesting
character, commencing a few years before "<span class="sc">Adam</span> delved
and <span class="sc">Eve</span> span," and finishing in the time of steam yachts; so that
it is brought right up to date. It is full of incident and picturesque
description. I see Mr. <span class="sc">Farjeon</span> has been at it again with the
<i>Mystery of M. Felix</i>. <i>Felix</i>&mdash;Happy Thought. Mr. <span class="sc">Harry
Furniss's</span>
<i>Academy Antics</i> is entertaining reading, and some of the

<h3>IN THE KNOW.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.</i>)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Every</span> jackass who ever was seen in the pig-skin
knows perfectly well, or ought to know, unless his brain
has gone barnacle-hunting in one of Mr. J.'s journalistic
bum-boats, that a race is to take place at Epsom in the
early part of next month. It has been customary to
speak of this race as the Derby, and to imagine that
the owner whose horse wins it gains possession of the
Blue ribbon of the turf. As if, forsooth, in a matter
like this, the colour mattered in the very least. But I
have a further objection to this hugger-mugger, three-cornered,
rag-and-bone, vermilion-faced, grog-blossomed,
hash-headed fashion of describing things, and it is this.
If a two-year-old, provided with one of Mrs. <span class="sc">Partington's</span>
patent range-finding, rectangular brooms, can beat
an unbroken four-year-old over the Nose-bag Handicap
Course by fourteen shoe-nails in a hundred, how in the
name of all that is lop-sided can a three-masted frigate
in full sail keep up with a Chinese Junk on Southampton
Water? I pause for a reply, but knowing the anserous,
venomous imbecility of the vermin who infest the turf,
I think it will be a long time before I get one.</p>

<p><i>Crimson Jack</i> is a good horse&mdash;no thanks to the
puddling and pilfering slop-shop proprietors who manage
him. When he used to draw a dust-cart in Grosvenor
Square he accustomed himself to the sound of the saddling
bell, and now knows when luncheon time has
arrived. A year ago, I wouldn't have given a copper
shirt-stud for him, never having even heard of him.
Now I believe him to be worth even more than the £10
given for him by the Ropes Contingent. But I have
got my eye on them, and they know it. The mooncalves
* * * gruel-brains * * * puddling simpletons * * * muddy
and pernicious rascals * * * dolts, dumplings and dunderheads
* * * poisonous, pestilential, crawling, goose-faced
reptiles * * * rely on it I know. * * *</p>

<p>[There has been no time to send this proof for correction,
and it has, therefore, been printed as it was received,
gaps and all.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ed.</span> <i>Punch.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="sc">Some</span> amusement was created at the Anniversary Dinner of the
United Crossing-Sweepers' Provident Association, held last night,
by the Noble Chairman's reference to his early experiences on a
West End crossing. What he saw then had led him to believe, he
said, that the lot of one who preserves the boots of the public from
mud is not all beer and skittles. He had, however, formed a very
exalted idea of the dignity of the calling to which they all belonged.
It is, of course, well known that the Noble Earl owed his rise from
the position of broom-holder to an opportune legacy from an old lady,
whom he saved, at the risk of his own life, from being ground to
powder by a runaway costermonger's barrow.</p>

<hr />

<p>A Correspondent sends us some interesting notes of meteorological
observations during the past month. "I have noticed," he writes,
"that under certain atmospheric conditions the streets and pavements
of the Metropolis are invariably damp. This phenomenon is
generally preceded by the withdrawal of the sun, followed almost
immediately by a prevalence of <i>imber</i>. After this has lasted for
some time, it is usual for the water-carts to make their appearance."</p>

<hr />

<p>"<span class="sc">A Manchester Mother</span>" makes the following pertinent observations
on the fashions prevailing amongst men at the present day.
"Why," she asks, "should some men prefer boots with buttons,
while others like their boots laced? Why again should it be considered
right for some men to wear dark blue overcoats, and for
others to wear black? Finally, if a man standing six foot two in
his stocking-feet is to a bank holiday as a six-inch collar is to a pork-pie,
how comes it that a tartan waistcoat and a pair of green plush
trousers cost five shillings and sixpence per square inch?" We
confess that we are unable to find answers to these questions.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two Policemen were yesterday observed in earnest conversation
with a well-known member of the Bermondsey Bull-pup Club.
Eventually the three Gentlemen departed for an adjacent police-station,
their proceedings forming a subject for animated comment
amongst the juvenile population of the neighbourhood.</p>

<hr />

<p>Four receptions, six public dinners, five evening parties, and eight
dances were given in different parts of London yesterday, "to meet
Mr. <span class="sc">H. M. Stanley</span>." We are glad to know that the great explorer
maintains his imperturbable good humour.</p>

<p>2. Given log. &middot;321 and density &gamma;&lambda;&upsilon;&epsilon;, how much Port would you
deduce from this?</p>

<p>3. Show under what circumstances P'liceman x<sup>2</sup> = Two-and-sixpence.</p>

<p>4. What is the probability of two blue eyes becoming black if A,
a stranger, wins half-a-crown three times running at a baccarat-table
in Tottenham Court Road? Calculate to five places of decimals
the chances of A's appearance as prosecutor at Bow Street next
morning.</p>

<p>5. Construct a set of Tables showing how the interest increases
in a geometrical progression as the principal is paid off. A., a flat,
goes to B., a money-lender, to raise £100. A. receives £7 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
in gold; what balance will he receive in grand old sherry and
real Havana Bremerhaven cigars?</p>

<p>6. Show how to re-construct a series of Companies (on the square),
with a million capital, within two months of formation, in such a
way that the Shareholders get nothing, and still remain liable for
future calls. Is the root of the above operation to be found in
defective legislation?</p>

down what I knows myself, and I'll get all
the best blackers of the day to tell me what
they knows about it, and then I'll set the lot
together and get it printed. Fact is, I got put
on the job by a feller who come to see me
'tother day&mdash;a tidy young sprig, full of all
them new notions. Says 'e to me, "<span class="sc">Bill</span>,"
'e says, "'ow do you walk?" "Why," I say, "on two legs
like the rest of 'em; what do you think?" "No," 'e says,
"that ain't what I mean, you Juggins" (there's a pretty word
to use to one old enough to be his father); "what is the process
you go through in walking?" "Well," I says, "if that's what
you're up to, I mostly puts one foot in front of 'tother, and
arterwards brings the back foot forrard and leaves 'tother behind."
"Ah," says 'e, "that's jest where you make a bloomin' errer.
Your brain sends a message through your nerves, and then you set
to work, movin' the extenser mussels and the glutyus maksimus,
and there you are." Well, I thought about that a lot, and on the
top of it I got 'old of a book called the Art of Authorship, by Mister
<span class="sc">George Bainton</span>, who's agoin' to teach everybody 'ow to write
things pretty and proper, and make no end of money out of it.
Pr'aps, thinks I to myself, there's more in blackin' boots than meets
the eye. I'll write about that on the same plan, gettin' all the
fellers I know to 'elp me. Fust, I drew up a lot of questions, and
I sent 'em round. Then when the ansers come in I got a young
chap, who writes for the <i>Camberwell Star</i>, to polish 'em up a bit
with grammar and spellin', asking 'im to do it like Mister <span class="sc">George
Bainton</span>. I've jest dropped in a word or two of my own 'ere and
there, to show what I mean. So 'ere they are, Sir, and quite at
your servis; and I knows if you prints 'em, there's many a boot-black
unborn, as'll bless your name, not forgettin',</p>

<p class="author">Yours truely,</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Introduction.</span></h4>

<p><span class="sc">In</span> putting these notes together, I have been animated solely by
the desire to enable those, whom motives of self-interest, or of
ambition, or the irresistible impulse of innate genius, may induce
to enter upon the profession of blacking, to acquire by living examples
of acknowledged ability, a true and genuine perfection in the art.
For art it is. Let nobody undertake it lightly. There is no room
in the busy throng of ardent blackers for the idler or the fribble.
Such men may write books, they cannot black boots. Style is everything,
style which colours the boots, roots itself in them, and uplifts
them to the highest pinnacle of Art. (N.B.&mdash;I took this sentens
nearly strait from <span class="sc">George Bainton</span>.&mdash;<i>B. the B.</i>) Therefore, my
young friends, study style. Whenever you see a well-blacked boot
in the street, in the counting-house, or in the sanctity of home, fix
your eyes upon it. Thus you will learn, and may in time black
boots as well as I do myself.</p>

<p>(N.B.&mdash;<span class="sc">George</span> writes the most extronery fine English, I'm told,
and o' course 'e wants the young 'uns to do the same. Same with
me and the boots.&mdash;<i>B. the B.</i>)</p>

<p>My first answer is from <span class="sc">James Huggins</span>, who as is well-known,
polishes the foot-coverings of the innumerable visitors who throng
to the Transcontinental Hotel. He says, "you ask me how I
acquired my unquestioned ability as a blacker. I answer, 'by constantly
studying the best models.' When I was quite a small boy
I used to polish all the boots within reach, and I well remember my
father humorously remonstrating with me, when he found me
blacking an old pair of worsted slippers given him by my mother.
There is a method of breathing on some boots and of spitting on
others, which can only be acquired by long practice. A large boot
with many knobs, is best for a beginner."</p>

<p>Next I addressed my inquiries to <span class="sc">George Brewsher</span>, more generally
known under his nick-name of <span class="sc">Dandy Geordie</span>. No man has a
wider reputation. His reply is instructive. "It is useless," he
says, "to study models. I tried that, and the result was that I
used to black all the patent leathers, and varnish the ordinary ones.
So I gave up study and relied upon my own talents. At the present
day, nobody in the whole world can put a truer shine on the dampest
boot. I scarcely know how I do it. I only know I do it. I always
keep my brushes in good order, drink a toothful of gin at bed-time,
and never let a single day pass without blacking something."</p>

<p>My next reply was from <span class="sc">Lemuel D. Dodge</span>, of New York, a boot-polisher
whose delicate and refined style has won him admirers in
this country as well as his own. "Character," he observes, "is
everything. I always analyse my blacking three times over, and
then lay it on thin with a camel's hair-brush. I find this method
much more satisfactory and less tiring than the rough and ungainly
scrubbing so much in vogue with your English artists."</p>

<p>Miss <span class="sc">Sally Pippin</span>, who officiates in The Metropolitan Ladies'
Boot Emporium, kindly sends me the following notes. "I have
had no education at all. I find it quite useless. All you require is
to make a shine. It's as easy as shelling peas. By the way, I
always wear my hair brought up at the back. This hint may be
useful to intending bootblacks."</p>

<p>(That's enough for one go, I rayther fancy. There's lots more o'
the same sort all ekally valuble, but I mustn't let you have it all at
once.&mdash;<i>B. the B.</i>)</p>

<h3>EARLY GREEN PEAS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">There's</span> a pleasure in Rhubarb, fresh, early and red,</p>
<p class="i2">When it comes with the flush of the newly born year,</p>
<p>There's a joy in the tasty Asparagus head</p>
<p class="i2">That is met with in soup, be it thick,&mdash;be it clear!</p>
<p>There's delight in the oyster; a peace that ne'er fails</p>
<p class="i2">In the placid enjoyment the Plover's egg brings,</p>
<p>A sense of calm peace in your nicely cooked quails,</p>
<p class="i2">But oh! there's one dish that will crown all these things;</p>
<p>For what, with such rapture the palate can please</p>
<p class="i2">As the first welcome helping of Early Green Peas!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>You may bring me Clyde salmon, three shillings the pound,</p>
<p class="i2">Red mullet in envelope, done to a turn,</p>
<p>The young spring potatoe, dug fresh from the ground,</p>
<p class="i2">The daintiest cream from a Devonshire churn:</p>
<p>You may offer me salad that's almost divine,</p>
<p class="i2">With a chicken so plump it should gladden the heart;</p>
<p>You may say, "Wash that down with the best brands of wine,</p>
<p class="i2">And follow it up with young gooseberry tart!"</p>
<p>My reply is but this, "Ah! withhold all of these!</p>

<p><span class="dropcap1">T</span><b>HE</b> FIVE O'CLOCK TEA BONNET COMPANY.&mdash;Under the
above title a Fashionable Company has been inaugurated by
several high-born, but impecunious Ladies, who, importing a model
bonnet from Paris, and reproducing it in British materials, with
more or less success, hope, by a judicious association of the shopkeeping
instinct with the <i>recherché</i> gloze of the best social circles, to
dispose of their stock to a <i>clientèle</i>, consisting of the many toadying
and snobbish friends who would be caught by the idea of purchasing
their bonnets at an establishment where their orders would be taken
by an impoverished Lady of title, and delivered at their residences,
possibly, by the daughter of a Baronet or Nobleman, in reduced
circumstances. The rooms of the New Company that will be shortly
opened at the West End, in the immediate vicinity of Bond Street,
though supplied with a counter on which a few of the choicest
exhibits of the establishment can be displayed, will be in all other
respects furnished after the fashion of a Modern Upper-class May-Fair
Drawing-room, to which intending Purchasers will need no
voucher of admission beyond that furnished by their own visiting-card,
on presentation of which they will be greeted as friends,
making an afternoon call, by the Fore-lady, who may be temporarily
presiding over the Show-room. Indeed, the key-note to the <i>raison
d'être</i> of the <span class="sc">Five O'Clock Tea Bonnet Company</span> will be found in the
happy combination of High-class social intercourse, with a satisfactory
adhesion to the principles of ordinary West-End shopkeeping. No
special prices will be attached to the articles sold, but they may be
regarded on the whole, considering the advantageous social circumstances
under which they are established, as generally a little in
advance of those asked at the leading Professional West-End Establishments
of a similar kind. A generous margin in this direction
must, therefore, be looked for in the account. Bills, if required, when
contracted by well-known Leaders of Society, may stand over for
years, but a very handsome interest will, of course, be expected, in
the event of a long-delayed settlement.</p>
